================================
The PEPT Library's Documentation
================================

A Python library that unifies Positron Emission Particle Tracking
(PEPT) research, including tracking, simulation, data analysis and
visualisation tools.


Positron Emission Particle Tracking
===================================
PEPT is a technique developed at the University of Birmingham which allows the
non-invasive, three-dimensional tracking of one or more 'tracer' particles
through particulate, fluid or multiphase systems. The technique allows particle
or fluid motion to be tracked with sub-millimetre accuracy and sub-millisecond
temporal resolution and, due to its use of highly-penetrating 511keV gamma
rays, can be used to probe the internal dynamics of even large, dense,
optically opaque systems - making it ideal for industrial as well as scientific
applications.

PEPT is performed by radioactively labelling a particle with a positron-
emitting radioisotope such as fluorine-18 (18F) or gallium-68 (68Ga), and using
the back-to-back gamma rays produced by electron-positron annihilation events
in and around the tracer to triangulate its spatial position. Each detected
gamma ray represents a line of response (LoR).

Transforming gamma rays, or lines of response (left) into individual tracer
trajectories (right) using the `pept` library. Depicted is experimental data of
two tracers rotating at 42 RPM, imaged using the University of Birmingham
Positron Imaging Centre's parallel screens PEPT camera.


Tutorials and Documentation
===========================

A very fast-paced introduction to Python is available `here (Google Colab tutorial link)
<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Uq8Ppiv8jR-XSVsKZMcCUNuXW-l6n_RI?usp=sharing>`_; it is aimed at engineers whose background might be a few lines written MATLAB, as well as moderate C/C++ programmers.

A beginner-friendly tutorial for using the `pept` package is available `here (Google Colab link)
<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8XHP9zWMMDVu23PXzANLCOKNP_RjBEO>`_.

The links above point to Google Colaboratory, a Jupyter notebook-hosting website that lets you combine text with Python code, executing it on Google servers. Pretty neat, isn't it?


Performance
===========
Significant effort has been put into making the algorithms in this package as
fast as possible. Most computationally intensive code has been implemented in `Cython`, `C` or `C++` and allows policy-based parallel execution, either on shared-memory machines using `joblib` / `ThreadPoolExecutor`, or on distributed computing clusters using `mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor`.

All public ``pept`` subroutines are fully documented here, along with copy-pastable examples. The `base` functionality is summarised below; the rest of the library is organised into submodules, which you can access on the left. You can also use the `Search` bar in the top left to go directly to what you need.

We really appreciate all help with writing useful documentation; if you feel something can be improved, or would like to share some example code, by all means get in contact with us - or be a superhero and click `Edit this page` on the right and submit your changes to the GitHub repository directly!
